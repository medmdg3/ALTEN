Introduction:
	This folder have for an objectif to approximate a trajectory with some arcs. This was made mainly to make it easier to make a car follows a trajectory.
Instructions:
	The file named "out.txt" have to contain the total number of a points as the first value, then the coordonate of the points in space, here we ignore the value of z and it is considered to be always a 0.
	After running both "Decomposition.exe" and "Test.exe", the both "out2.txt" and "out3.py" will change content, the first will contain informations about the arc, while the second contains a python3 file who will draw both the original and the approximated trajectory
	Inside both of those files, there some customisable functions that will help you to approximate the trajectory the way you want to.
My vision:
	I strongly believe that finding an approximation to the "Best decision" to be made by the driver in a given set of arcs is much easier to be found, specially by AI or using some manual calculs.
