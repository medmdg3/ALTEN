\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_circle}{Circle}} \\*Introducing circles as a new struct, they are determined with a center O and a radius r }{\pageref{struct_circle}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_matrix}{Matrix}} \\*This class is used to represent a matrix using a vector of vectors of the same size }{\pageref{class_matrix}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_polynomial}{Polynomial}} \\*Helps manipulate Polynomials; it uses a vector of long double to represent each of them }{\pageref{class_polynomial}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_segment}{Segment}} \\*Introducing \doxylink{struct_segment}{Segment} as a new struct, it is defined by two edges a and b }{\pageref{struct_segment}}{}
